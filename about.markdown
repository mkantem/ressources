# About this resource

## Purpose

This site is designed to provide educational resources and practical guidance for workshops, class and training sessions based on my area of interests in research. The resources are aimed at supporting learners and professionals who are interested in improving their understanding of programming, data science, social media analysis, non-coding tools, language learning, etc....

The materials are also freely available to the public under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). You are encouraged to use, modify, and share these resources in accordance with the license.

### Bilingual content

Depending on the context in which a specific content or workshop was created, you might encounter resources in either **English** or **French**. This reflects the linguistic diversity of the course/traning I do. So, you should expect content in both languages on this resource page, as we aim to make knowledge accessible to a wide audience.

## Tools used in building this site

This site was built using the following open-source tools:

- **Jekyll**: A static site generator that simplifies the creation of fast, customizable websites.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub:
[jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)


[jekyll-organization]: https://github.com/jekyll

- **Just the Docs**: A Jekyll theme that provides a clean, simple, and organized layout for documentation.
- **GitHub Pages**: Used to host the site, ensuring it's easily accessible and open for public collaboration.
- **Markdown**: For simple formatting of the site's content.
- **HTML and CSS**: Custom tweaks for layout and styling.
  
These tools were selected for their ease of use, flexibility, and adherence to open-source principles.
